This example shows how to use OpenAI CLIP to encode images as embeddings and store them in TiDB Serverless. It also demonstrates how to use the CLIP model to encode query text and search for the most similar images.

Try it in the [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pingcap/tidb-vector-python/blob/main/examples/image_search/example.ipynb).
