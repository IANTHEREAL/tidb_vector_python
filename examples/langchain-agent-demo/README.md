# LangChain Agent Demo

An Agent demo, Classify and Extract information from text using TiDBVectorClient, LangChain, and LLM.

e.g.    
input: "At My Window is an album released by Folk/country singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt in 1987."

query related documents: 
  - "At My Window (album) | At My Window is an album ... "
  - "Little Window | Little Window is the debut album of American singer-songwriter Baby Dee. ... "
  - "Storm Windows | Storm Windows is the seventh album by American folk singer and songwriter John Prine, released in 1980. ... "
   
classify the input text: `{"category": "album", "reason": "The document is about an album named 'At My Window'."}`
   
This demo is similar to the official cookbook, but replaces the knowledge part with tidbVectorClient. It tests the
project's compatibility with both the official features and LangChain.

## Prerequisites

- TiDB Serverless cluster
- Python 3.10 or later
- Ollama or OpenAI
- langchain==0.2.10
- langchain-community==0.2.9

## Run the example

### Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-vector-python.git
```

### Create a virtual environment

```bash
cd tidb-vector-python/examples/langchain-agent-demo
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set the environment variables

Get the TiDB connection string via `TIDB_HOST`, `TIDB_USERNAME`, and `TIDB_PASSWORD` from the TiDB Cloud console, as
described in the [Prerequisites](../README.md#prerequisites) section.

The TiDB connection string will look like:

```
mysql+pymysql://{TIDB_USER}:{TIDB_PASSWORD}@{TIDB_HOST}:{TIDB_PORT}/{TIDB_DB_NAME}?ssl_verify_cert=True&ssl_verify_identity=True
```

### Run the example
```text
python ./tidb-vector-python/examples/langchain-agent-demo/example.py 
Connected to TiDB.
